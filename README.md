# What an Interface Can Do

This is a presentation on the subject of interfaces in
[Go](https://golang.org/), presented at the
[Utah Go User Group](http://www.meetup.com/utahgophers/)
on 4 November 2014.

It is written using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js),
a nifty HTML5 slideshow framework. As such, it is a clone of that project's
[github repository](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
