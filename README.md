# What an Interface Can Do

This is a presentation on the subject of interfaces in
[Go](https://golang.org/), presented at the
[Utah Go User Group](http://www.meetup.com/utahgophers/)
on 4 November 2014.

It is written using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js),
a nifty HTML5 slideshow framework. As such, it is a clone of that project's
[github repository](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

I wasn't sure which of the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
project files were necessary to make the slideshow work, and I didn't have time
to figure it out, so I just cloned the entire project.

The differences between this project and reveal.js are as follows:

  * `index.html` has been edited to contain my presentation.
  * The `code` subdirectory has been added. It contains
      + sample Go programs (`p*.go`)
      + PNG files generated by the sample Go programs
      + various other pictures used to illustrate the talk
  * [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) has been updated to version 8.3.


## Upgrading highlight.js

I just wanted to change the code highlighting style.
Reveal.js has only one code-highlighting theme, `zenburns.css`,
and `zenburns.css` does not go well with the reveal.js theme I wanted to use:
`simple`.
The highlight.js `idea` theme is a much better match to 
the reveal.js `simple` theme.

The design of highlight.js has changed since reveal.js included it,
so it was not sufficient to just copy over `idea.css` from the
current highlight.js; it was necessary to upgrade highlight.js itself.
That change is reflected in `plugin/highlight/highlight.js`.
